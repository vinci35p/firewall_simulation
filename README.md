Since I am very interested with cybersecurity, I decided to take on my final project referencing the work of faanross: https://youtu.be/UfyF6CvL4Ts?si=rpunH_DWXDZhfmww, with creating a simple firewall simulation without delving to much more in to it's complexity. 
And I thank faanross for the idea and guide on how I'll make the code. His yt channel: https://www.youtube.com/@faanross
